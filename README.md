create a folder, create 3 new folders inside the folder named as database, template and static and inside static add all the css files and inside template add all the html files and the pictures go inside static folder too.
im sure the database wont work so you would have to create an sql server with the help of xampp
and the app.py not to be inside any folder except for the main folder
